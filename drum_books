I have taught from and played through hundreds of drum books over the years.
I'm going to try to put what I feel are important books about drumming.
Either because they have something no other book has or they have important historical significance.
After all, this is a tradition.
We can and should try to expand on it, but the more you can internalize the shoulders your standing on the better. 
Otherwise you are floating in space with no referrence. Which could be fun I guess. 

Ok. 

First important drum books are fairly up in the air. 
the basics are fairly boring no matter how they're presented.
Seeing a drummer do something imporessive is far more impactful than a picture in a book.. or even worse.. dots on lines!
So having a good teacher or even an audio recording to accompany to book material is crucial.
Now with Youtube and streaming online video classes, books are becoming less and less relevant.
But if you like flipping through pages and concentrating on paper instead of a screen I recomend some good books.
Since touch is a part of the instrument, until virtual reality gets that good, to get the full experience of a master teacher, you must be there to experience them hitting you.. or the drum

All beginer drum books are the same. Just learn the main types of notes and how to count. 
Some books count 1-tah-and-tah for 16th notes some don't tell you how to count at all. 
I like 1-e-and-ah, but it doesn't matter what you say as long as you know what you're talking about.
So for a beginner book, my first teacher started me with

** Haskel W Harr snare method **

I did book one and two and the second one started introducing accents and syncapation which is where drumming really starts getting fun.

So any first book for the reading and understanding of the five notes/rests (whole, half, quarter, 8th, 16th)
All of these beginner books introduce time signatures, triplets, dotted notes, and accents in slightly different orders, but I don't think it really matters. 
Most if not all of these subjects are best illustrated with inspiring relevant musical examples. Otherwise again.. just dots on a page.

it would be rare for any drummer/drum teacher not to mention George Lawrence Stone when asked about important drum literature. 

** Stick Control ** will almost always get mentioned, but even better is ** Accents and Rebounds **

Both incredibly repetative and black and white books, but incredibly important.
Not only was George Stone an amazing snare drummer and percussionist, but if studied and practiced in the "right" way, these books are the most of the rudimental tools you need. 
Some great drummers (Rick Considine is one) would argue that you only need a handful of these rudiments and to apply them in different ways.
They would say you don't need to practice every inversion and since the drums are (typically) not setup symetrically why would you practice everything both right and left handed.
Some even play traditional grip which when I asked Fred Buda if I should practice trad he said "Its like wearing a combat boot on one foot, and a highheel on the other.. don't bother"
He was just taught that way.

So although these books are monatonous permutations of every possible inversion of the rudiments, you build a lot of drumming vocabulary if you practice them.

A famous drum story is that Elvin Jones (arguably one of the most influencial jazz drummers) wasn't allowed to get a real drum until he mastered all his rudiments on a pad. 
I think it was his strict father (its fun to remember it this way) made him wait 7 years before letting him play on real drums. 
Often these stories turn into exagerated legend, but I can definitely relate. I played with drumsticks on a chair for most of my first rudimental and independence development.
You have to be ok going slow and repeating RLRRLL RLRRLL for extended periods of time if you're ever going to be a great drummer
or something like that

OK.. another classic

** Syncapation by Ted Reed **

This book is another one that every drummer/drum teacher has come accross. Sometimes its curious how these traditions get locked into the culture.
Often I think it gets seperated from the purpose of the tradition. It becomes simply because my teacher taught me this I will teach you this. 
Thats fine, but without proper context this book is pretty bad. I don't think it does any explaining in the actual text.
i could be wrong, but the real jazz drumming tradition
