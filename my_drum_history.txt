When I started 6th grade I remember being really exited to start taking an instrument. 
I remember sitting in the auditorium and Mr. Yianni introducing himself and the instruments.
I don't know what made me choose the drums. In fact, I remember it being kind of arbitrary.
I wanted to play them all, but I went for the snare drum.
Which by itself is admitidedly boring. 
But not only did I excell at Mr. Yainis demanding teaching style, but I ended up taking private lessons with him.
I think it was in 7th grade when I started with Mr. yianni privately, but all through middle school, I competed with Dave Zabagalski.
We continued to swap 1st and 2nd chair with occasionally chris heikle sneaking ahead (he was a year ahead of us)

Ok, So I got the basics. Learned some rudiments. I remember seeing mr. yainni do a bounce and buzz roll and thinking there was no way I would ever do that.
I learned how to read rhythm. quarter, 8th, 16th notes and rests. The book we used was Haskel W Harr.
I remember one two line exersize that used accents and syncapation. 
I remember getting it under my hands and feet (mr yainni was strict about quarter note tapping with foot)

** Its hard to emphasize how important/influencial/illustrative it is to learn this skill. Tap on quarter notes (and eventually whatever pulse you want)
	I've only heard one music teacher argue against tapping your foot which was simply because she didn't want students depending on it.
	She had picked up along the way that in an orchestra etc is was inappropriate to tap ones foot. So she learned not to.
	My response was simply that just because you can do it doesn't mean you have to.
	I was more concerned with students that couldn't do it. 
	You could argue that syncapation doesn't exist without the juxtaposition of a pulse to be syncapated against.
	Tapping with a foot or other body part insists that you are actually feeling/understanding the syncapation.
	
!!DrumSet!!

You could say that by learning snare while tapping your foot is really the basics of drumset, but I hadn't actually sat behind a kit until 8th grade.
We were going to have a christmas concert and mr yianni wanted someone to play drumset. I was really between me and Dave Z and he had a drumset at home.
I asked mr. yianni after band class how I would have a chance without actually owning a drumset. 
He told me about the hihat in the left foot and the ride cymbal on the right hand. 
He told me it didn't really matter what I was hitting, as long as I coordinated the limbs. 
That night I struggled with my first four limb beat. Intro to independence.

** This real lesson came much later, but i'll log it in here. Independence and Dependence!
	People talk a ton about independence in drumset playing, but there isn't a ton of talk about dependence.
	The are strongly connected and understanding flat flams and the variable gap between close transients is an amazing drumming superpower
	I'm not particularly good at it : )
	
I ended up beating out dave for the drumset part. He was dissapointed and I was appropriately pleased. I worked very hard getting that jazzy christmas beat.
I remember it being the standard jazz time with hihat on 2 and 4. I don't remember learning about swing then, but I think the ride pattern was based of a triplet. 

!! Rock and Roll !!

My parents were already exposing me to cool bands/artists. 
I also had a paper route that gave me an hour plus of alone time to listen to my walkman every singal day.

** Listening ** Listen to as much music as you can. Make it diverse and never be afraid to examine sounds/music that makes you uncomfortable. 
	Some music is difficult to listen to at first, but if you give it a chance it is likely to add something to your palette. 
	Critical listening vs Casual is another topic. Passive enjoyment of music and dance can be incredibly fun and rewarding, but critical listening involves concentration and focus.
	Just like meditation, you can shine the spotlight of attention on different aspects of concsienceness.
	Holding concentration on different elements of a piece of music is key to learning/developing as a musician. 
	Focusing on a different instrument or even individual notes of a harmonic instrument is a great challenge/exersize
	
On new years eve of my 8th grade year my mom and I went down to Rutland, VT for first night.
We ended up in some school gym or community center with a highschool rock band playing.
They were soooo awesome. Tokyo Storm Warning.. they are hard to find. 
I had to convince my mom to get me a $10 cd, but she gave in and I've thanked her ever since.

(As I was writing this, I wrote joe calabrese.. another drummer who happened to have an old cd case of mine
its been over a decade since weve talked and he still has it! we are going to meet up next week!
I am excited to listen and will see about uploading the tracks or some highlights.)

I not only listened to that cd a million times, but I studied it in depth.
Not only the drums which were awesome and challenging, but I also started learning the guitar parts which were also awesome.

I did get a little drumset somewhere in there. My dad got me a used kit with a kick drum and a couple toms. 
I don't think it came with a snare so I used my school one.
Since it didn't have cymbals I used the rims and beat my sticks up.
I remember my first cymbal which was a $90 ziljian splash. 
Pretty sure it was the cheapest cymbal and I didn't care it was so tiny.
It became my ride, my hihat, my crash.. I definitely hit that cymbal a bunch.

At some point in my sophmore year of highschool my nextdoor neighbor in our connected building said they couldn't take the drumming.
They had tolerated me getting louder and playing longer and longer for a couple years. I had even added a guitar and amp and sometimes jammed with friends.
No longer. A dear friend let me put my drumset in their basement where I was allowed to go anytime, but I sadly did not take advantage of that very much.

So in highschool I wasn't really a drummer. I had dropped out of band not wanting to be bored in the back of the room. I was not excited about school band music.
I was experimenting with drugs and electronic music. I was listening to phish and the mahavishnu orchestra. Medeski martin and wood soon became a favorite.
When I was a freshman, I ended up in a shortlived band with a new friend and a cool upperclassmen. our only show is embarrasing and I think theres a video somewhere.
I bought a fostex x-55 multitrack tape recorder with my paper route money and a ddr-770 drum machine. I'm pretty sure I sold both for cheap. 
That roland drum machine and that era of the mid late 90s was interesting transitioning into digital. 
most of the gear was trendy and pretty limited, but there were a few gems that still get love. and probably now the most shitty ironic piece of gear gets its own love from hipsters. 

I got into hiphop and rapping. 
Not totally drum related, but definetly a huge influence on everythng to do with my musical world view.
I ended up defending hiphop and electronic music against jazz purists and old school musicians. 
this was before berklee had a dj and electronic musician program and degree.
but I kind of self taught myself to play guitar and produce with other tools besides the drumset. 
I took scattered private lessons and jammed with a few people. 
Most importantly I was starting to have a deep instinctual understanding of phrasing and nuance. Tone and time.

Time and tone. I learned this idea/phrase my freshman year of college.
I kind of fell into the Castleton State College music program, but I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do. 
So music education was it in this tiny music program where I was the only percussionist (oh yea! jesse!!! I wonder where he is) and there was maybe 10 music majors.
The two main professors were Mr. Aborn and Mr. Wheeler?? I don't think thats right, but I can picture him and learned a lot from him. 
Mr. Aborn was really old (I ended up writing a local obit for him), but had tons of energy and passion for music. 
He helped spark a deep love of classical music through debussy and other greats. 
He shamed me into learning how to read notes on a staff (i'm still not great at it)
He taught me that at its most basic components music is just two things

** Time and Tone
	time is horizontal and tone is vertical. at least thats how he explained it and what I got excited about. 
	I've since thought about how tone is even a product of time so its all just horizontal. Even light is just a frequency.. radiation waves!!
	but for practical uses.. especially for reading music and thinking about harmony and rhythm, it is very useful to think in those two simple dimensions.
	I had become fairly versed in the rhythmic horizontal approach, but didn't really know the vertical at all
	time to study harmony
	
So a combination of getting shamed into reading music and the only percussion teacher on staff was a marimba player.
So I was encouraged to study marimba 
My first year was basics.. getting comfortable with the mallets and learning scales and a few pieces.
A serious missed oportunity was the summer of 2000 I had a full sized marimba in my bedroom. I barely played it.
I did give myself the mission of recording it and learned about dynamic vs condenser mics. I baught my first condenser mic.. a sm94.. It actually captured what a 58 couldn't. 
I suppose I barely started to get two mallets in one hand, but I was not devoted. it was hard and I was 19. 
That next school year, I knew I wanted to transfer to another university and had to get my shit together. 
I was going to audition to another music school which meant I really needed to prepare some pieces. 
I practiced pretty regularly although I never really got good at marimba. I had a mediocre at best performance of Yellow After the Rain (an early four mallet piece) and knew my scales.
I saw some kids at Ithaca way better than me that were fresh out of highschool. Gordan Stout was a world class marimba player and I was probably the worst he saw that day.
my drumset skills did not make up for it.

I was however welcomed into UMASS Lowell where arguably even better teachers reside. 
Jeff Fisher is an amazing classical percussionist and I got to study with Fred Buda who is one of the best swinging jazz drummers ever. both amazing teachers.
I would say although I learned a ton from them i was also a disapointment. 
I was focused on social things and being in bands/musical projects. I was not practicing classical marimba or snare drum. 
I was finally surrounded by some pretty good musicians who I could make original music with and grow with. 
I should mention that although I was in "bands" at Castleton, I always knew I would outgrow it. 
No offense to teachers or peers there.. It was a formative experience, but for some reason I had to leave Vermont or something.
So UMASS and Lowell is where I would say any mature musical learning started.

That first year at UMASS I studied calculus and met musicians. 
I was welcomed into bands as a new young drummer in the scene.
A group of seniors in the Sound Recording department invited me to be in their band and record a demo.
My first time in a pretty legit studio recording drums. The King Friday EP

I also met Phil, Brandon, and Dave that year. I think we really started getting serious that second semester. 
Dr. Professor began. Dave was a few years older than me and was a really good guitar player.
Phil and Brandon were two years younger than me and we started playing a few times a week. 

That following summer I got surgery on my shoulder. 
It was an important summer for me musically.
I wasn't able to drum or use one arm at all for a couple months.
i did what I called "electronic etudes". everyday for two months I worked on a new project that used some kind of new plugin or technique recording I had never used before. 
Sometimes I fell in love with the track and developed it further, and sometimes that was the only day I looked at it. 
But I learned a ton about DAWs and wrote a bunch of music. 
That following school year I went back pretty much healed and with a few dozen new ideas.

Most of my practice on drums was with the band. 
I always had practicing in my mind and was chugging along in lessons, but I was never a person who consistantly practiced 8 hours a day.
Not even 4 most days. 
I did write a ton of music and I also got pretty good at playing drumset while singing/rapping
It was actually one of Dr. Professors draws.
At the same time Phil, Brandon, Scott and I were in a jazz ensemble for 2 credits at school.
As a music major you needed to be in ensembles and we were able to turn our normal musical situation into a class
we did start by digging into REal book tunes, but we gravitated towards the funkier latinier ones.

jazz is quite the universe. I will probably devote an entire section/document to jazz and jazz drumming, but i'm going to move on

In my early and mid 20s is when I tried to figure out what I really wanted to do. 
At that time although drums was my primary instrument, I didn't care about being the best drummer in the world.
I resolved to make "timetone hits". Which was basically an uncomprimizing approach to a satisfying piece of recorded music. 
I also was in enough different musical projects that I decided to start a record lable. 
Brian Redmond who was a big influence on me in terms of technology and audio science/recording
He started his own record lable and I wanted to unify a handful of diverse artist with a record lable like umbrella.
None of this has a ton to do with drumming, but it certainly helped shape me as a musician. 
After a few years of building momentum, lowercase p (the main band on the lable) broke up and the rest of the lable deteriated.

Around age 23 I started teaching drums. I took over for a great drummer in the area. I want to say jeremy. 
He was a few years older than me and was taking a full time position leaving a handful of students behind. 
It was intimidating, but he told me a few books he was working on with students and I dove in. 
I worked at university music for 6 or 7 years. I taught hundreds of students over those years and saw some young drummers grow into great musicians. 
Teaching does a lot for understanding. And I had been interested in education in the first place so i took it seriously.
I developed systems to inspire students and structure important concepts. I borrowed from all the teachers and lessons I learned from. 
Youtube was still in its early stages in 2004 when I started teaching, but I remember that starting to threaten some teachers. I thought it was a great resource.

I'm definetly meandering and I want to keep this drum focused, but it is my personal history. 
People connect through stories and personal experience. Teachers communicate through their experience whether they are intentionally or not.
I try to illuminate areas that took me a long time to understand. 
As much as it can only be done with hard work, knowing where to put that hard work is priceless.
there are shortcuts.. you just need to know where youre trying to go.. and sometimes the scenic route is worth it. Just be cautiuos of going to far into the woods.
Unless you really like the woods.
